  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
  <p>I have started programming a few months ago and it's been an incredible journey so far.
    Every day I learn something new and I really enjoy that I can do more and more.
    I've created this website with the purpose of showing off my amazing new skills ðŸ˜Š
    This website is changing day-by-day as I learn more.</p>
  <p>Please look around and let me know if you have any questions.</p>
  <p>Thank you, Anita</p>
